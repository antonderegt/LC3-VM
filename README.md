# LC-3 Virtual Machine Written In C

With the help of [Justin Meiners](https://github.com/justinmeiners) I wrote a VM that runs assembled assembly.
Tutorial link: [Write your Own Virtual Machine](https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/)

## Building
```
gcc lc3.c -o lc3
```

## Running
```
./lc3 path/to/assembled_code
```

## ISA

## Games
These games are written in assembly and run in the VM. Here's the link to download [2048](https://github.com/rpendleton/lc3-2048).
